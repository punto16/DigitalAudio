Due it has some assets from Unity Assets Store, here some rules in order for it to work and a little explaination of everything included.

In "Game" tab, select cam display to Display 2 (Display 1 is the main character prefab tester)

You can move using wasd, jump with spacebar (it not always jumps, I don't really know why)

When you spawn you will hear ambient sound (some birds), and base music.

If you move you will hear stepsounds of grass (because you are in grass)

If you enter any building your stepsounds will be of wood.

If you enter the house at your right when you spawn, you will hear calm music, if you exit, music will be base music again.

If you enter any other house, you will hear combat music, if you exit, music will be base music again.
